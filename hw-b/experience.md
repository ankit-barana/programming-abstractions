We used the following resources in this assignment:
1. Ruby Programming Wiki - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Syntax

After installing rust and learning about its properties, we just started working on the problems. We first came up with the pseudocode for each of the problems and then looked for relevant syntax information as needed. For eg., if we needed to use a while loop, we just went to the link to the documentation/syntax to see how it can be used.
